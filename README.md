# Authentication Using Firebase

Project Name: Authentication

This project is a web application that demonstrates how to implement user authentication using Firebase and React. It allows users to create an account, login, and logout, reset password with email.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
To-Do List with Authentication

A to-do list with authentication is a web application that allows users to create, manage and track their tasks while also requiring authentication for access. This project typically involves implementing features such as user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionality.

In this project, The Tech used is React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. The project features a simple and user-friendly interface, with the ability to add new tasks, edit and delete them, and mark them as completed. Users are required to register and login before they can access the to-do list features.

Firebase Authentication was used to handle the user authentication process, with email and password as the login method. And also implemented a password reset feature that allows users to reset their password via email verification.


This project was a great opportunity to practice implementing user authentication in a real-world application, while also improving the skills in React and Firebase integration.


## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I learned a lot about user authentication, especially when it comes to implementing it with Firebase. We also improved our skills in React, including state management and building reusable components.

and also learned the importance of keeping the user interface simple and intuitive. As developers, we can get caught up in adding too many features and making things too complex. However, it's essential to keep in mind that the end-user should have an easy time navigating and using the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
